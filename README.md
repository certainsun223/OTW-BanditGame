# Level 0 — Connect to the Server

This document contains my personal notes and hints for **Bandit Level 0**.  

---

## Goal
The objective of Level 0 is to connect to the Bandit server via `ssh`.

---

## Key Concepts
To connect using `ssh`, you always need three things:

- Server IP / hostname  
- Username  
- Password  

The basic SSH syntax is:
```bash
ssh username@host

ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
# Use 'bandit0' as the password as well
